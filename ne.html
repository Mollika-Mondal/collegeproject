		<h4>The story of Bhojohori Manna began out of a  <br>
		garage space at Ekdalia, Kolkata in March 2003.<br>
		Five friends from diverse backgrounds with no <br>
		formal F & B training but having a passion for <br>
		food and people,reckoned from their own personal<br>
		experiences that there was a vacuum in Kolkata<br>
		for simple 'home style' Bengali food. The name<br>
	    Bhojohori  Manna was chosen from a popular Bengali <br>
	    film song rendered by the legendary singer Manna<br>
	    Dey. The humorous track "Ami Sri Sri Bhojohori<br>
	    Manna..." revolves around a widely travelled <br>
	    cook who returns to his native land with a <br>
	    signature culinary style.The business model <br>
	    was inspired charming old world concept of<br>
	     
	    'pice hotels'â€‹and moulded to the requirements <br>
	     of the day.<br>
